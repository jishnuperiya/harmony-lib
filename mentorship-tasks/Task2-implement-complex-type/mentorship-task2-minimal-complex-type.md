## Exercise 1 – Minimal `complex` struct

### What I Did
- Defined a `struct complex` with two members: `double real; double imag;`  
- Explicitly wrote out the following special member functions (even though the compiler would normally generate them):  
  - **Default constructor**  
  - **Non-default constructor** (takes two doubles)  
  - **Copy constructor**  
  - **Copy assignment operator**  
  - **Destructor**  
- Added simple `printf` messages in each function to observe when they are called.
